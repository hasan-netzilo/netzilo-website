                                    "Confidential Information" means all information disclosed by a party to the other party, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Netzilo Confidential Information includes: the software for the Netzilo Solution, whether in source or executable code; Research (as defined in Section 8.2) materials and information; nonpublic business, product, marketing, pricing and sales information; audit materials and reports; internal policies, procedures and controls; and the results of any performance tests of the Netzilo Solution. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing party; (ii) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party without breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing party; (iii) is received from a third party without knowledge of any breach of any obligation owed to the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that Personal Data (defined in the DPA) is not considered Confidential Information and the terms of the DPA, not this Section 6, shall govern the parties' obligations with respect to Personal Data.

The receiving party's obligations relating to protection of Confidential Information under this MSA shall continue for three (3) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, except that in the case of Confidential Information that is a trade secret under applicable law, the obligations of confidentiality shall continue for so long as such Confidential Information remains a trade secret.

If the receiving party is compelled by law to disclose the disclosing party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the disclosing party is a party, and the disclosing party is not contesting the disclosure, the disclosing party will reimburse the receiving party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.
