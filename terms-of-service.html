                            Please read these Terms carefully as they affect your legal rights. By creating or administering a Netzilo account and accessing or using the Netzilo Solution, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which, together with the Data Processing Addendum and Special Terms (in each case only if and as applicable to you) comprise the "Agreement" between you and Netzilo. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Netzilo Solution. If you are entering into the Agreement on behalf of a company, organization, or similar entity, you are agreeing to the Agreement for that entity and representing to Netzilo that you have the authority to bind such entity to the Agreement.

Some jurisdictions, including the Province of Quebec, do not allow binding arbitration or the disclaimer of class action rights. Accordingly, some of the foregoing terms may not apply to you or be enforceable with respect to you.

The Fees for your chosen Plan and payment period (typically monthly or annually) will be specified at the time of purchase when you "check-out" on the Netzilo Platform. Unless explicitly indicated otherwise in these Terms, our Documentation or at the time of "check-out", all payments will be made by credit card.

You may change your Plan at any time by following the instructions in our applicable Documentation. If you choose to change your Plan before the close of a payment period, the Fees due at the next payment period will be prorated accordingly, you will remain responsible for any unpaid Fees under the prior Plan, and our services under the prior Plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, renewal of any free, complimentary, promotional or one-time priced services will renew at our applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal.

Customer will be responsible for and pay all applicable Taxes, duties, tariffs, assessments, export and import fees or similar charges (including interest and penalties imposed thereon) on the transactions contemplated in connection with these Terms, other than Taxes based on the net income or profits of Netzilo. If Customer is a tax-exempt entity or claims exemption from any Taxes hereunder, Customer will provide a certificate of exemption upon agreement to these Terms and, after receipt of valid evidence of exemption, Netzilo will not charge Customer any Taxes from which Customer is exempt.

Unless set forth otherwise in your invoice, all invoices are issued in United States dollars, and each invoice is due and payable thirty (30) days from the invoice date according to the payment instructions provided on the invoice. You agree that we may invoice you for any unpaid Fees at any time during the payment period. You may add a purchase order number to an invoice, if necessary for your internal payment processing requirements. If Customer disputes any amount set forth in any invoice, you must notify Netzilo within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date or you will be deemed to have waived your right to dispute such amount. The parties agree to work in good faith to resolve any payment dispute.

If, after working in good faith with the Customer, Netzilo is not successful in resolving the Delinquent Account, any interest will accrue on past due amounts at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, but in no event greater than the highest rate of interest allowed by law, calculated from the date such amount was due until the date that payment is received by Netzilo. Customer will reimburse Netzilo for the reasonable costs of collection, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys.
