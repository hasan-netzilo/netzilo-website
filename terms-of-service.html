                            Please read these Terms carefully as they affect your legal rights. By creating or administering a Netzilo account and accessing or using the Netzilo Solution, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which, together with the Data Processing Addendum and Special Terms (in each case only if and as applicable to you) comprise the "Agreement" between you and Netzilo. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Netzilo Solution. If you are entering into the Agreement on behalf of a company, organization, or similar entity, you are agreeing to the Agreement for that entity and representing to Netzilo that you have the authority to bind such entity to the Agreement.

Some jurisdictions, including the Province of Quebec, do not allow binding arbitration or the disclaimer of class action rights. Accordingly, some of the foregoing terms may not apply to you or be enforceable with respect to you.

The Fees for your chosen Plan and payment period (typically monthly or annually) will be specified at the time of purchase when you "check-out" on the Netzilo Platform. Unless explicitly indicated otherwise in these Terms, our Documentation or at the time of "check-out", all payments will be made by credit card.

                                    As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information. The receiving party will: (a) use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care); (b) not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party for any purpose outside the scope of the Agreement; and (c) limit access to Confidential Information of the disclosing party, except as otherwise authorized by the disclosing party in writing, to only those employees, agents and contractors (including its Affiliates, legal counsel, auditors and accountants) who (i) need that access for purposes consistent with the Agreement and (ii) are bound to obligations of confidentiality that are not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those contained in this MSA. Upon the expiration or termination of this MSA, the receiving party shall have no further rights to the disclosing party's Confidential Information and shall promptly destroy all materials (whether maintained electronically or otherwise) containing such information, together with all copies thereof in whatever form; provided however that the receiving party may retain copies for archival purposes as required by applicable law or to the extent such copies are electronically stored in accordance with the receiving party's document retention or back-up policies or procedures. The receiving party's obligations relating to protection of Confidential Information under this MSA shall continue for three (3) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, except that in the case of Confidential Information that is a trade secret under applicable law, the obligations of confidentiality shall continue for so long as such Confidential Information remains a trade secret.

                                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed to the extent required by any competent court or governmental agency. Before disclosing such information, the receiving party must (if permitted by law) provide the disclosing party with sufficient advance notice of the request for the information to enable the disclosing party to exercise, at its own cost, any rights it may have to challenge or limit the request to receive such Confidential Information. If the receiving party is compelled by law to disclose the disclosing party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the disclosing party is a party, and the disclosing party is not contesting the disclosure, the disclosing party will reimburse the receiving party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.

                                    Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees ("Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this arbitration provision. If the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less, Netzilo will pay for the Arbitration Fees, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim or counterclaim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. For disputes valued over $75,000, the Arbitration Fees will be split equally between the parties. If the arbitrator determines that either the substance of a claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of Arbitration Fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any Arbitration Fees paid on the claimant's behalf.

                                    The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

Further, unless both you and Netzilo agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
